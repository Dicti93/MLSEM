## Working with Git
Always ensure your local repository is up to date and manage your changes efficiently using the following commands:

1. **Update Your Local Repository**
    ```bash
    git pull origin master
    ```
    - `main` is our default branch. Replace with another branch name if needed.
    - **IMPORTANT:** Always run this before starting work to ensure you have the latest changes.

2. **Check Status**
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    - Use this to see if there are any changes or files ready to be committed.

3. **Stage Changes**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    - Adds all modified and new files to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

4. **Commit Changes**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
    ```
    - Snapshot your changes locally. Replace the text within quotes with a short, descriptive message of what you've done.

5. **Upload Changes**
    ```bash
    git push
    ```
    - Pushes your committed changes to the remote repository.

### Best Practices
- **Commit Often:** Small, frequent commits help track changes and resolve conflicts more easily.
- **Descriptive Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages to describe the changes made.
- **Pull Regularly:** To minimize conflicts, regularly update your local repository with the latest changes from the main branch.
